# C2E - Test Scaffolding

c2e is a Mocha/Chai & Cypress.io test scaffolding helper loosely aligned with TOGAF, Agile & other common concepts to produce end-to-end test files mapping organizational (c)apabilties to(2) (e)xpected outcomes / criteria (i.e. expect(A).to.equal(B), cy.get().contains(), etc)

üö® c2e is currently under 'organic' development, any use or contribution is more than welcome üôè

### <u>Input ~~JSON~~YAML file</u>

C2E currently processes ~~JSON~~YAML files using the following basic structure;</br>
See `.\examples\example-input.c2e.yaml'` for more detail.

```
|-> Version
|-> Capability
    \-> Storyboard
        |-> Action(s)
        \-> Scene(s)
            |-> Action(s)
            \-> User Story(s)
                |-> Action(s)
                \-> Criteria(s)
                    \-> Expectation(s)
```

Note: only variables on the 1st line of code under an Action will be hoisted.
Note: for object validation using json-schema the schema needs to be added to the ajv object e.g. `ajv.addSchema(schema,schemaID)`. To validate an object in an Expectation call `validateObject(object,schemaID)`.

## <u>Usage</u>

From the folder containing \*.c2e.~~json~~yaml file(s) run `c2e`</br>
In the current folder C2E will generate folders & files for each Storyboard e.g.`".\{Capability}\{Version} {Capability} {Storyboard}.spec.js"`

## <u>Roadmap</u>

- [x] Define input `*.c2e.ymal` file structure & output folder(s) / `*.spec.js` file(s) structure
- [x] Generate Cypress.io ready `*.spec.js` file(s) with basic test types from `*.c2e.json` file(s)
- [x] Add support for object validation tests using AJV, json-schema to be loaded from \*.json file(s)
- [ ] Add `*.c2e.json` schema validation & feedback
- [x] ~~Update `*.c2e.json` file(s) from `*.spec.js` file(s) structure (i.e. enable 'round trip' generation)~~ Cancelled: Replaced through use of watching \*.c2e.yaml files to allow update on change & using Cypress.io file watching mode.
- [ ] Add `*.c2e.yaml` GUI editor

## <u>Change Log</u>

- 0.0.2 Changes to input file format & added functionality;
  - Changed input format from .json to .yaml to make generation of inputs easier for non-technical users, support of multiline editing & use of code highlighting tools (e.g. https://github.com/iuyoy/highlight-string-code)
  - Added support for hoisting variables up one grouping
  - Added support for hoisting imports to start of .spec.js
  - Added support for object validation using AJV
  - Changed to file watching & re-writting of .spec.js files on .c2e.yaml change (...works with Cypress.io in watch mode)
- 0.0.1 Initial release
